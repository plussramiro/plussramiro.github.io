### Teaching Assistant - Bioinspired Robotics, ITBA (Sep 2024 - Present)

I support laboratory sessions, student project development, and office-hour guidance in the Bioinspired Robotics course at ITBA. The course is led by Dr. Pablo Martín Gleiser.

Current course focus:
- Building basic robotic agents, including three-wheeled platforms with distance and light sensors inspired by Braitenberg vehicles.
- Implementing baseline rule-based control in code, then replacing fixed rules with simple neural-network controllers.
- Developing sensorimotor interaction with the environment through adaptive control strategies.
- Prototyping and implementing robotic models for applications across science, industry, and art.

These showcased robots are demonstration platforms; the course provides the tools and foundations to build comparable systems.
