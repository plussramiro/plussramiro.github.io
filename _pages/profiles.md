### Lab Focus

Our work combines computational neuroscience, connectomics, complex systems, and bioinspired robotics. We study how network structure and neural dynamics shape behavior, and we translate those principles into embodied robotic platforms.

Current lines include:
- Connectome-informed embodied control with C. elegans and Drosophila references.
- Experimental and educational robotics testbeds for closed-loop sensorimotor interaction.

### Lead Researcher

**[Pablo Martin Gleiser](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WlU_A_UAAAAJ&hl=en)** is a physicist (BSc and PhD, National University of Cordoba, Argentina) and completed postdoctoral research at the Complex Systems Department, University of Barcelona, Spain.

His academic work includes 50+ scientific publications and interdisciplinary research across social-network analysis, connectomics, circadian rhythms, sleep studies, and robotics. His research keywords include biological rhythms, synchronization, and complex systems.
