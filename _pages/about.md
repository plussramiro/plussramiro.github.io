I am a physicist with a B.Sc. in Physics (Licenciatura en Física, a 9-semester undergraduate degree including a research thesis) from the National University of Rosario (UNR), at the Faculty of Exact Sciences, Engineering and Surveying (FCEIA), and I am currently a PhD candidate in Engineering at the Buenos Aires Institute of Technology (ITBA). My research aims to understand the bidirectional relationship between structure, neural dynamics, and behavior, examining how anatomical and structural organization shapes, and is shaped by, neural activity and motor behavior. I combine computational neuroscience, neural network models, and bioinspired robotic systems to study proprioception and embodied motor control.

In previous work, I studied how changes in connection density in adaptive networks of chaotic units impact cluster synchronization and structural properties such as integration and segregation, a balance that is central in neuroscience and complex systems. I have also applied hemispheric-specific Wilson-Cowan models to human connectome data from control subjects and patients with schizophrenia, improving the modeling of resting-state functional connectivity and exploring how robustness and asymmetries emerge at the network level.

Currently, I am working with robotic models driven by real connectomics data from *Drosophila* and *C. elegans* to explore embodiment, autonomy, and sensorimotor feedback. These connectome-based architectures can be viewed as biologically pre-trained networks, offering a bridge between neuroscience and robotics while reducing reliance on conventional artificial training. Through this line of research, I aim to contribute to autonomous and bioinspired robotics, long-range exploration, and broader questions about how structure, dynamics, and embodied interaction give rise to behavior and intelligence in both biological and artificial systems.
