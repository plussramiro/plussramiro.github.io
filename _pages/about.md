My name is **Ramiro Plüss**, a physicist and Ph.D. candidate at ITBA. My work focuses on the interplay between structure, neural dynamics, and behavior. I build models that combine computational neuroscience with robotic systems inspired by biological connectomes. 

I completed a B.Sc. in Physics at UNR–FCEIA and previously investigated synchronization and network properties in adaptive chaotic systems, as well as hemisphere‑specific Wilson–Cowan models applied to human connectome data. More recently, I develop biomimetic robots driven by *C. elegans* and Drosophila connectome architectures, exploring autonomy and sensorimotor integration.

My research aims to bridge neuroscience and embodied robotics, contributing to autonomous systems and understanding how structure and dynamics give rise to intelligence.

<summary>More details about my background and interests</summary>

I have studied how modifications in connection density affect cluster synchronization and the balance of integration–segregation in complex networks. Work with schizophrenia patient data helped refine models of resting‑state functional connectivity. 

Current projects leverage connectome‑based controllers for robotic prototypes, treating biological wiring as an inductive prior. These investigations touch on bioinspired design, long‑range exploration, and the foundations of behavior in both living and artificial agents.
