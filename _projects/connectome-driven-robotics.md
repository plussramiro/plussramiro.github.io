This ongoing line of work uses real connectomics data from *Drosophila* and *C. elegans* to design embodied control systems.

The central hypothesis is that connectome-based architectures can operate as biologically pre-trained networks, reducing dependence on conventional artificial training while preserving rich sensorimotor dynamics.

Current focus: Embodiment and closed-loop feedback. Robustness under perturbations. Transfer of structure-function principles from neuroscience to robotics. This specific composite figure is centered on *C. elegans* references.
