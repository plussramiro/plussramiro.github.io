This project extends a large-scale Wilson-Cowan framework to include hemispheric-specific coupling based on empirical structural connectivity.

The objective is to improve agreement between simulated and empirical resting-state functional connectivity, especially in cohorts comparing control subjects and patients with schizophrenia.
