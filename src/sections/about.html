    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
        My name is Ramiro Plüss. I am a physicist, graduated from UNR–FCEIA, and currently a PhD candidate at ITBA.
        My research aims to understand the bidirectional relationship between structure, neural dynamics, and behavior,
        examining how anatomical and structural organization shapes, and is shaped by, neural activity and motor behavior.
        I combine computational neuroscience, neural network models, and bioinspired robotic systems to study proprioception
        and embodied motor control.

            In previous work, I studied how changes in connection density in adaptive networks of chaotic units impact
            cluster synchronization and structural properties such as integration and segregation, a balance that is
            central in neuroscience and complex systems. I have also applied hemispheric-specific Wilson–Cowan models
            to human connectome data from control subjects and patients with schizophrenia, improving the modeling of
            resting-state functional connectivity and exploring how robustness and asymmetries emerge at the network level.

            Currently, I am working with robotic models driven by real connectomics data from Drosophila and
            <em>C. elegans</em> to explore embodiment, autonomy, and sensorimotor feedback. These connectome-based
            architectures can be viewed as biologically pre-trained networks, offering a bridge between neuroscience and
            robotics while reducing reliance on conventional artificial training. Through this line of research, I aim to
            contribute to autonomous and bioinspired robotics, long-range exploration, and broader questions about how
            structure, dynamics, and embodied interaction give rise to behavior and intelligence in both biological and
            artificial systems.
