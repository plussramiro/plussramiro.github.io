  summary: >
    My research focuses on the bidirectional relationship between network structure, neural dynamics, and behavior, combining computational neuroscience, network models, and bio-inspired robotics to study proprioception and embodied control. I build bio-inspired robotic testbeds to study embodied motor control with computational neuroscience models.
